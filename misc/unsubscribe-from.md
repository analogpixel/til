# How to Unsubscribe from ...

## Physical Mail
* stop mail from "value" (newspaper like wad of coupons in your mailbox every other day) :  https://save.com/mailing/delivery-options
* stop other random marketing mails here: https://www.dmachoice.org/ 

## Place that refuse to let you unsubscribe
Some place thinks it's more important to send you trash than for you to be
a customer;  It's probably best not to deal with these companies at all 
since they probably have a bunch of other shady business practices.

* AeroGarden : doesn't allow you to unsubscribe.
* Khol's : allows you to unsubscribe but ignores it and keeps sending emails.
