# Macos plaintext paste by default


 in “System Prefs -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts,” under ”App Shortcuts, All Applications,” you can add the following:

    "Paste and Match Formatting" = Command+V
    "Paste and Match Style" = Command+V

It's funny, but I had to add both. The former works in MS Word and the latter works in Evernote. Thus, if it's not working for some application, you can probably look under Edit menu and see what they call the non-formatted pasting that you want.

I also like to add:

    "Paste" = Shift +Command+V

So I can paste with formatting.
