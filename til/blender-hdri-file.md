# Blender HDRI files

HDRI files are 3D HDR images that you can look around in.

## Using them in blender
- world properties
- Surface : background
- color: load and HDRI image
( you can then go into then nodes to see this under world )
- Under the Render Properties menu, you can select Fil-> Transparent if you just want the refelected bits on your object but don't want to see the actual HDRI background.
