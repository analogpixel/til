# ITerm2 duplicate tab

If you want to open a new iterm tab in the same directory you are currently in,
you can just duplicate the tab.  There isn't a default key binding to do this,
so you just need to go into keybindings and bind something to duplicate tab.

Now after you kick off a process that takes over that terminal (a server), you can
just duplicate and get right back to the correct directory.
