# Math Properties of Exponents

- Law of Product: a^m Ã— a^n = a^(m+n)
- Law of Quotient: a^m/a^n = a^(m-n)
- Law of Zero Exponent: a^0 = 1
- Law of Negative Exponent: a^-m = 1/a^m
- Law of Power of a Power: (a^m)^n = a^(mn)
- Law of Power of a Product: (ab)^m = a^mb^m
- Law of Power of a Quotient: (a/b)^m = a^m/b^m
