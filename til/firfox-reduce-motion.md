# Firefox reduce motion setting

`In Firefox about:config: Add a number preference called ui.prefersReducedMotion and set its value to either 0 for full animation or to 1 to indicate a preference for reduced motion. Changes to this preference take effect immediately. `

In macos system preferences, you can also reduce motion system-wide which firefox will pick up.  but I want to see animated gifs in firefox which is turned off by reduced motion, but I don't want to see desktop animations that slow everything down.
