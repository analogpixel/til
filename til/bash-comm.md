# comm, select or reject lines common to two files


`comm` is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is used to compare two sorted files line by line.

so if you have two files, `file1` and `file2`, you can use `comm` to compare them and see what lines are common to both files, what lines are unique to `file1`, and what lines are unique to `file2`. kind of like diff but better for scripting.
