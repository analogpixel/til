# CLI Remote pbcopy (remote data to local clipboard)

when on macos, pbcopy allows you to send data to the clipboard.  but [remote-pbcopy](https://github.com/skaji/remote-pbcopy-iterm2)  allows you
to do this on a remote machine using iterm2.  

I have an alfred snippet setup to paste the perl version of remote-pbcopy since most machines have perl installed.  Now I can quickly create pbcopy remotely
and get the contents of files easily.
